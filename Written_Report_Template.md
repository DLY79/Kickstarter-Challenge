# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise's Kickstarter campaign in support of her play, Fever, is performing well in a short period of time.  Louise has requested an analysis on other plays that were part of a Kickstarter campaign to determine:
    a) A possible correlation between campaign launch date and its subsequent success/failure;
    b) The success/failure rate, in relation to the goal set in the campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our first task was to look at the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns based on the month they were launched. Using a PivotTable, we were able to sort through the data to highlight only the number of successful, failed, and canceled, broken down by month.  From here, a line chart was created to visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Our second task was to analyse the outcomes of campaigns, categorized by their fund-raising goal. We are trying to determine if there is a relationship between the size of the goal and whether it was successful or not. Using IFCOUNTS formula, we were able to easily pull the relevant data out of the larger population. We created another line chart to visualize the data:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
