# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise's Kickstarter campaign in support of her play, Fever, is performing well in a short period of time.  Louise has requested an analysis on other plays that were part of a Kickstarter campaign to determine:
    a) A possible correlation between campaign launch date and its subsequent success/failure;
    b) The success/failure rate, in relation to the goal set in the campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Our first task was to look at the outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns based on the month they were launched. Using a PivotTable, we were able to sort through the data to highlight only the number of successful, failed, and canceled, broken down by month.  From here, a line chart was created to visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
